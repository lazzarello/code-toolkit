This is a repository of my random crypto playing around.

one_time_pad.rb: an implementation of a simple base 25 alphabetic 
 stream cypher cryptosystem based on the Ruby rand() method for secrecy. While
 far from a real one time pad it's still fun to mess around with.

diffie-hellman-exchange.rb: a simple proof of a Diffie Hellman exchange to be
run in two concurrent terminals. The input is a little weird and my
exponentiation and primitive root generation system is waaaay off. But it does work for small
input values.
